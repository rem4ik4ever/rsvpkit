## Startup Kit

This is a boilerplate monorepo dedicated to quickly start working on new startup idea. This monorepo includes everything that developer might need. In reality this is my attempt to capture everything RoR can afford out of the box, without leaving JavaScript ecosystem since so called "ecosystem" is so scattered there is no one solution. 

## What's included?
- Next.js frontend
  - tailwindcss
  - shadcn
  - react-hook-form
  - zod
  - zustand
  - urql
- Keystone backend
  - admin cms
  - Apollo graphql
  - Password Authentication
  - Google oAuth
  - Email using nodemailer
  - BullMQ workers
  - Prisma ORM
  - Stripe subscriptions
- React Email

This setup is more than enough to create any kind of business or at least get up and running.
